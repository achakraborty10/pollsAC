<h2> Hello Everyone, My Name is Arup Chakraborty</h2>
<p>I was born in the eastern part of India. After finishing my masterâ€™s degree in Botany I moved to the USA for a higher degree in Chemistry.
    <br>Currently, I am a faculty at the College of Pharmacy in Henderson, Nevada. My future goal is to work with data science especially
    <br>data mining from big clinical trials. I wish I have little more time in hand to improve this web application </p>
